Bugs:
  * There appears to be a small bug in the recursive dependency resolution
    when only the package name is given as the requirement

Enhancements:
  * Add --add-url to enpkg:
    This should check the URL (using the current authentication in
    .enstaller4rc and then (if the URL can be accessed) prepend it
    to the IndexedRepos list.

  * More Documentation and Examples
