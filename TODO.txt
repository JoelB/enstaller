Enhancements:

 * Add ability to list summary strings from EGG-INFO/spec/summary in an
   index file, such that the enpkg --search option will also search in
   (as well as list) summaries.

 * Add an --update option to enpkg which for each installed package
   checks if an update is available, and if so installs it.

 * Since the Version 4 enpkg command is using egginst, and since the new
   enpkg and egginst commands do not use setuptools code anymore,
   setuptools can be removed.
