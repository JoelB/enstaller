Enhancements:

 * Add ability to list summary strings from EGG-INFO/spec/summary in an
   index file, such that the enpkg --search option will also search in
   (as well as list) summaries.

 * Since the Version 4 enpkg command is using egginst, and since the new
   enpkg and egginst commands do not use setuptools code anymore, it is
   worth considering to take setuptools of out Enstaller entirely.


Bugs:

 * Post install script (setuptools) may get run multiple during the
   install process.
