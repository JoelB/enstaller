2014-08-30   4.7.1:
-------------------

Dummy release to work around a bad 4.7.0 on pypi.

2014-00-00   4.7.0:
-------------------

Main highlights:

  * authentication handling has been streamlined. When credentials are missing
    and/or invalid, enpkg displays an error message instead of crashing (#144).
  * enpkg always uses the same authentication method, whether keyring is
    installed or not.
  * support for python 2.5 has ben dropped
  * add use_pypi = True/False configuration entry to enable/disable pypi repo
    access (True by default)
  * add enpkg-repair script to fix .egg-info directories
  * egginst and enstaller now use logging instead of print statements. Verbose
    output may be obtained through 'enpkg -v', very verbose through
    'enpkg -v -v'.
  * add the -y option to automatically answer yes everytime enpkg prompt the
    user for confirmation
  * ask for confirmation when installing unsupported pypi eggs

Bug fixes:

  * #144: enpkg crashed when credentials were invalid, or when requesting
    packages requiring credentials while not authenticated.
  * #149: handle invalid proxy strings gracefully.
  * Handle Ctrl+C gracefully, and don't print a traceback anymore. Returns an
    exit code of 130, as usually returned by aborted programs on Unix.

Internals:

  * enstaller internal configuration is not a singleton anymore.
  * Store classes are gone, and Repository instances are used instead
  * Enpkg class is now only concerned with execution: dependency resolution is
    done through a separate Solver class. It also allows for iterator-based
    execution for integration with 3rd party packages.
  * urllib* has been replaced by requests
  * configuration is properly parsed instead of being exec'd.
  * remove undocumented and unused 'enpkg --revert file' feature.
  * remove undocumended hook feature

2013-12-16   4.6.3:
-------------------

Main highlights:

  * Add support for cancellation in fetch API
  * Undocumented feature --freeze/--requirement (used internally @ Enthought
    only)
  * Don't print the traceback when crashing anymore, unless ENSTALLER_DEBUG is enabled
  * Egginst now installs eggs in a way that follows easy_install more closely.
    In particular, entry points should now be recognized correctly.

The project setup has been significantly improved however:

  * Code coverage nearly doubled
  * Unused code (e.g. hook feature) has been removed from egginst
  * Added requirements for dev + tox setup + travis-ci + coveralls.io

All earlier versions
--------------------
All earlier versions of Enstaller used a completely different architecture
and design and were quickly deprecated from active usage due to instability
problems.
