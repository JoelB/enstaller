4.1.4
-----



4.1.3
-----
* PKG-INFO file is now placed in site-packages as
  <name>-<version>-py<major>.<minor>.egg-info

* removed unused enstaller.indexed_repo.platforms module

* allowing a placeholder '{ARCH}' in the list of indexed repositories
  in the configuration file which gets substituted by 'amd64' or 'x86',
  depending on the architecture of the current interpreter.
  This allows having a single configuration file on systems which have
  more than one interpreter installed.

* added ability to handle release candidate versions


4.1.2
-----
* fixed development versions being sorted incorrectly

* improved to use normalized path in MachO headers



4.1.1
-----
* fixed enpkg bootstrapping problem



4.1.0
-----
* removed the setuptools patch

* added the 'index-tool' command which is a tool for creating an indexed
  repository of eggs which works with the enpkg command in Enstaller.

* added more tests and documentation

* added enpkg --proxy option which uses the proxy package from ensetuptools

* added egginst --prefix option to specify install prefix

* added ability to create a self-installing Enstaller egg, i.e. it is possible
  to execute the Enstaller if bash is installed.

* removed experimental egginst --activate and --deactivate options

* added enpkg --prefix and --sys-prefix option

* changed location of system config path to <sys.prefix>/.enstaller4rc



4.0.0
-----
* replacing enpkg by new-enpkg which uses egginst.  The old (Enstaller v3)
  enpkg command is still available and now called easy_manage, because it
  can manage setuptools installed packages.


3.1.1
-----
* more work on new-enpkg command and egginst


3.1.0
-----
* added the egginst package, an alternative for installing eggs, see
  egginst/README.txt


3.0.9
-----
* Fixed os.getuid(), in enstaller/config.py not being called on Windows

* added --ignore-enstallerrc and --ignore-pydistutils-cfg option to
  easy_install


3.0.8
-----
* Removed subprocess call which assumed that enpkg was on the path, which
  causes problems when working with multiple Python environments.


3.0.7
-----
* Added upgrade/update and rollback to enpkg.


3.0.6
-----
* Allowing pre-uninstall scripts to be named EGG-INFO/uninstall.py,
  this change was made for purely historic reasons.  This change does not
  interfere with the standard convention that pre-uninstall scripts are
  named EGG-INFO/pre_uninstall.py, just as post-install scripts are named
  EGG-INFO/post_install.py.  Naming pre-uninstall scripts uninstall.py,
  is not recommended, but still possible.


3.0.5
-----
* Added .enstallerrc (enstaller.ini on Windows) which contains default
  repositories.
* Fixed bug which prevented uninstall scripts (in the EGG-INFO folder) to be
  executed.
* Added installation instructions to README.txt
* Added --debug option which makes it easy to track down which Python is
  running easy_install (in particular useful on systems which have no which
  command).


3.0.4
-----
* Enstaller is now consistently spelled with capital E
* Added --version option to both enpkg and easy_install
* Cleanup of setuptools code


3.0.1 - 3.0.3
-------------
Minor bug fixes


3.0.0
-----
* Re-architected and re-wrote Enstaller using portions of old source code.
* First public release on PyPi


All earlier versions
--------------------
All earlier versions of Enstaller used a completely different architecture
and design and were quickly deprecated from active usage due to instability
problems.
